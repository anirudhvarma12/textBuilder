# textBuilder

Welcome to the textBuilder wiki!

This program lets you build automated text..
Suppose i have this piece of code (creating a custom keyboard via buttons)
`   <Button android:text="W"`
                `android:id="@+id/W"`
                `android:onClick="keyBtn_Click"`
                `android:layout_weight="1"`
                `android:layout_width="0dp"`
                `android:layout_height="wrap_content"/>`

Now similarly i want to generate same for e,r,t,y and so on.. I will not have to copy paste and edit them, simply by this program i can add any number of placeHolders and add the buttons

As i see android:text="**_W_**" and android:id="@+id/**_W_**
these two are variables so i add placeHolder i place of them and write the text in the list's as shown in the image given above.!

And in some seconds i can generate the whole keyboard code.!

There is option to add files, fill in with number, fill in with alphabets in the lists.!
