# textBuilder

Welcome to the textBuilder wiki!

This program lets you generate repeated text.

Eg. I am creating custom key bindings using the following code.
``` 
<Button android:text="W"`
                `android:id="@+id/W"`
                `android:onClick="keyBtn_Click"`
                `android:layout_weight="1"`
                `android:layout_width="0dp"`
                `android:layout_height="wrap_content"/>`
```
 This code has to be repeated for each letter that I want to bind. Instead of copy/pasting the code. Textbuilder would generate the code for me.

As i see _android:text="**_W_**"_ and _android:id="@+id/**_W_**_ are the two are variables, so I add placeHolder in their place and write the text in the list's as shown in the image given above.

And in some seconds i can generate the whole keyboard code.

There is option to add files, fill in with number, fill in with alphabets in the lists.
